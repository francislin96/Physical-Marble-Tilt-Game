# Physical-Marble-Tilt-Game
A LIS3DH accelerometer attached to an Arduino Uno controlled the motion of 2 TowerPro SG-5010 servos which tilted the platform of the physical marble tilt game. The frame for the game was 3D-printed using services on UCLA campus. An IR LED and phototransistor were placed at the end of the maze to detect when a small ball was covered the ending spot. The GUI for the game was written in Processing.
